# MVP

### Travel Planning Assistant

- Allow users to create an account - Allow users to sign-in to account
- Allow users to search a desired area for Hotels, Airfare, and Car Rentals
- Allow users to add and remove options to easily adjust the total price of the trip (kind of like ordering food online)
- App will display a clean look and running estimated total for current trip
- App will hit API's from rapidAPI.com for up to date pricing in searched area
- Allow users to save trip to profile to plan multiple trips - Allow users to share trips with other users
- Allow users to select how many people will be paying so the price can reflect total and/or individual price

### UI/UX

- Creating account
- Signing in / Logging Out
- Create trips - Selecting Hotels, Airfare, Car Rental
- Saving trips for later adding, editing, deleting
- Sharing trips with other users
- Manipulating total price to 'split the bill'
- Users can leave comments on their friends trips
- Users can accept invitations to trips

### Future Functionality

- Mobile Friendly
- Have the ability to book everything through the app rather than just seeing an estimated price
- Create some sort of chat room of sorts where you can see other couples travelling to your location
- Advertise local events in the area after booking
- Show some sort of live video footage of where you were travelling (who doesn't want to be on vacation the second you book it?)
